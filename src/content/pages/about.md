I've been developing websites, and web apps for the better part of 7 years. EastOh.Co is going to be my knowledge center, for myself, and others who happen to come across it. Currently EastOh.Co based out of beautiful Denver, CO, however I still have a massive love for my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA (hence the bridge, and the name but we'll get to that). This is a new adventure for me (<a href="https://twitter.com/_ericmiller" target="_blank">Eric Miller</a>), I've had a few things that I put out to the web, but none quite like this. 

The goal of this site is to help others understand emerging technologies in the web world. Here we will offer lots of tutorial series mostly focusing on front-end development, with the possibility of some server side code being thrown in as well. 

### My Stack
My stack varies day to day, seriously... ask anyone, I'll experiment then drop the technology like it's no ones business. The ones I like though stay around for a long time. I'm currently on a kick of JavaScript backend frameworks (think MeteorJS, and NodeJS) with that being said here are the technologies I use/work with the most:

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Compass
* JavaScript
* AngularJS
* NodeJS
* MeteorJS
* PHP
* Laravel Framework
* WordPress

### About the name
The name is personal to me rather than an all catching technology driven name. I'm from Pittsburgh and my love for the city is well known. The bridge you see in the logo is of the <a href="http://historicbridges.org/other/16th/little_p1220592.jpg" target="_blank">16th st. Bridge</a>, the name it self EastOh.Co derives from a street that I spent most of my time on while I was in Pittsburgh (5+ years) called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.453923,-79.997794,3a,75y,258.5h,75.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFuzqAYLxVyxv6K1--jcyQQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" target="_blank">East Ohio st.</a> it's located in the historic <a href="http://www.thepriory.com/images/neighborhood/eastohio12.jpg" target="_blank">Deutschtown</a> neighborhood of Pittsburgh a.k.a the North Side. I'm not currently living there, as I mentioned above I'm in Denver now, but I plan to be back in Pittsburgh in the next couple of years.
