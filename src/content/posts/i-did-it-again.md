description: I think the title sums up my approach to personal web development. I recently moved this site off of the custom cms type thing I had going with MeteorJS to a static site generator called [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/). It does the same as most static site generators, I just liked this one because I could build my own process similar to a gulp file.

I think the title sums up my approach to personal web development. I recently moved this site off of the custom cms type thing I had going with MeteorJS to a static site generator called [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/). It does the same as most static site generators, I just liked this one because I could build my own process similar to a gulp file.

That being said, this will officially mark the point where I've switched technologies more than I have written posts for this site in it's existence. I know I'm not the only developer to have this issue, but I'm having a had time understanding why.

For me it boils down to fun, I think I have more fun building things over and over than writing things. I will also change courses on a project or just scrap it all together because I found something else to sink my time in to. I like that about myself (always interested in something new) and I dislike that about myself (never finishing side projects).

With that being said...

### The New Me
In 2016 I'm going to try something new. That something new will be maintaining this site to the best of my ability, that means writing posts, creating tutorials, adding content, sharing my posts via social media. My hope is that if I put a project that I'm working on in to the public eye (whether thats a large crowd or my modest 50 views a week) it will encourage, and motivate me to at least get it to a minimum viable product.

Here's to 2016, and here's to hoping I can control my ridiculous habits!
